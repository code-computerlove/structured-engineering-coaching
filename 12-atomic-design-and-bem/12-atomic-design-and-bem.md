### Adaptive web

## Design systems

> We’re not designing pages, we’re designing systems of components.
>
> -- Stephen Hay.

Colour, typography, grids, texture, shape, form etc.

Patterns in user flow, content strategy, copy, and tone of voice.

To create a cohesive feel.

## Atomic design

> Atomic design is methodology for creating design systems.

> -- Brad Frost

### Atoms

### Molecules

### Organisms

### Templates

## Block, Element, Modifier methodology (BEM)

Developed at Yandex, its goal is to help developers better understand the relationship between the HTML and CSS in a given project.

Blocks
Elements
Modifiers

Inverted triangle.
Most selectors for clocks -> Least selectors for modifiers.

## CSS in JS

The future?
