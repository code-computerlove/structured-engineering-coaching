## What is a programming language's purpose

### Machine code

```x86
05 2A 00
```

### Assembly

```assembly
add 42 ax
```

```assembly
section .text
  global_start               ;must be declared for linker (ld)

_start:                      ;tells linker entry point
  mov    edx,len             ;message length
  mov    ecx,msg             ;message to write
  mov    ebx,1               ;file descriptor (stdout)
  mov    eax,4               ;system call number (sys_write)
  int    0x80                ;call kernel

  mov    eax,1               ;system call number (sys_exit)
  int    0x80                ;call kernel

section .data
msg db 'Hello, world!', 0xa  ;string to be printed
len equ $ - msg              ;length of the string
```

Symbolic representation of instructions and memory addresses.

### Between high and low

```c
int main() {
   printf("Hello, World!");
   return 0;
}
```

Game changing leap in userbility. Originally considered a high level language it now sits somewhere between high and low.

### High level

```csharp
public class Volume {
  private readonly float _maxVolume;
  private float _currentVolume;

  public Volume(float maxVolume) {
    _maxVolume = maxVolume;
    _currentVolume = 0f;
  }

  public float CurrentLevel() {
    return _currentVolume / _maxVolume * 100f;
  }

  public void Add(float amount) {
    _currentVolume = new[] {_maxVolume, _currentVolume + amount}.Min();
  }
}
```

As far as a CPU is concerned there is no such thing as variables, arrays, if statements, functions, methods, namespaces, immutability, encapsulation or objects. Programming languages are abstractions for people.

At the end of the day, some bits in memory will have changed.

Many problems with a code base start when people focus on what code to write instead of how to solve the problem. If you don't have an appreciation of different languages then you're not considering all solutions to the problem.

### HolodeckScript ðŸ˜‰

Since the dawn of time, business has dreamed of not needing devs.

> There's no point in me teaching you C because by the time you leave university C will be obsolete.
>
> -- Andrew Grant's computer science teacher in the mid 90s

All attempts at getting business people to produce code have failed.

OOP was supposed to be HolodeckScript!

### A shiny new language

A language with no source files. Objects are created and edited directly in an IDE whilst the program is running. Able to pause and modify the program. Able to interactively fix bugs and errors whilst they're happening.

This language is Smalltalk. In some ways the industry has gone backwards from where it was nearly 50 years ago.

> Source code in files. How quaint.
>
> -- Kent Beck

It's often said that, "there are no new ideas". But in our discipline the same ones are discovered regularly. The main advances in computer languages are generally user friendliness.

## Learn multiple languages

If all you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like an an abstract factory interface needing a concrete implementation to be late dispatched in via an IoC framework.

Learn different paradigms and learn something non-"C style".

```fsharp
module String = // Module to make C# string extensions work more like F#
  let trim (s:string) = s.Trim()

  let toLower (s:string) = s.ToLowerInvariant()

  let replace (oldChar:char) (newChar:char) (s:string) = s.Replace(oldChar, newChar)

let replaceSpaceWithHyphen = String.replace ' ' '-'

let canonicalize = String.trim >> String.toLower >> replaceSpaceWithHyphen
```

If you want to have your mind totally blown, look at Prolog which was first released in 1972.

## Clean code AKA Habitability

As we said back in session 4, 10:1 ratio reading to writing but clean code is more than just readability. Cleanliness might be considered superficial so some people prefer the term "Habitability".

> Habitability is the characteristic of source code that enables programmers, coders, bug-fixers, and people coming to the code later in its life to understand its construction and intentions and to change it comfortably and confidently.
>
> Habitability makes a place liveable, like home. And this is what we want in software - that developers feel at home, can place their hands on any item without having to think deeply about where it is.
>
> -- Richard P. Gabriel

## Imagination time

Imagine you're in a large mansion. Someone asks "I'm going shopping, do I need to get baked beans?"

You'd look in the kitchen and pantry cupboards and be able to tell them with some confidence. "Yes, you need to get beans."

A bit of time has passed and:

- you've discovered assorted soup tins in a bathroom.
- a tin of corned beef you opened actually contained kidney beans.
- a handwritten note in a bedroom mentions a second kitchen but you've not found it yet.

If someone asks you the shopping question now you're more likely to say "I don't know. Even if there are beans I'm not sure we could find them. Maybe buy some beans just in case."

### Principle of least surprise

Problem 1, things aren't organised as expected.

If there's no inherent order to a code base then you don't know where to find existing functionality. You also don't know where to add new functionality. Things snowball from here.

### Don't repeat yourself

Problem 2, why is there (maybe) a second kitchen?

Are there more? Is there a reason for multiple kitchens? What aren't I getting?

But remember, too DRY is flammable.

### Refactor

Problem 3, why are we in a mansion? No one needs a mansion.

Code bases don't start as mansions.

Worse is better. Quality does not increase with functionality. Less functionality (the "worse" in the oxymoron) may lead to better quality.

Recognise that architecture needs to evolve over time. What was the correct architecture yesterday may not be the correct architecture today. This is fine and expected as business requirements will change over time.

Don't put off correcting architecture until you're in a corner.

Don't be afraid to remove functionality which is no longer needed/ isn't performing as expected.

Lines of code cost money to write but also cost money to maintain. Once code is written it's not free here on out.

## Tests as living documentation

Code and test framework is usually all that is needed for a clear and unambiguous specification.

Gherkin is bloated, repetitive, ambiguous and, a barrier to abstraction and modularity.

Treat tests like any other code. Refactor. Remove duplication. Delete when no longer needed.

## Clean code is hard

There is no magic process for writing clean code. Clean code is usually achieved through refinement. Don't skimp on refactoring.

Parkinson's Law of Triviality.

Recognise when you're bikeshedding.

Prioritise difficult or uncertain tasks ahead of those you're confident about and work to break them down and remove uncertainty. Otherwise you may end up in sunken cost fallacy death march.

A well maintained code base should be bikesheds all the way down.

## The campsite rule

You don't have to fix everything today but if you just give one variable a better name then you've improved things.
